DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                                               
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    ============== assistant ==============                                                                        
DEBUG    Below are the step-by-step instructions with bash commands that should help you resolve the timeout by ensuring
         the server binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just localhost.                                        
                                                                                                                        
         1. Check the pod description to confirm that the pod is running and to inspect its events.                     
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl describe pod kube-wrong-interface                                                                   
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         2. Update the server.py file so that the HTTP server binds to 0.0.0.0 rather than "localhost". Use sed to      
         replace "localhost" with "0.0.0.0":                                                                            
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's/("localhost",/"("0.0.0.0",/g'                                                                     
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/server.py                          
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Rebuild the Docker image so it includes the updated server.py. Change to the directory containing the       
         Dockerfile and build the image:                                                                                
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            cd /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface                              
            docker build -t marioutsa/kube-wrong-interface-app .                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Since the pod is already running an outdated container, delete the current pod and reapply the manifest so  
         Kubernetes pulls the newly built image.                                                                        
            - Delete the existing pod:                                                                                  
              ```bash                                                                                                   
              kubectl delete pod kube-wrong-interface                                                                   
              ```                                                                                                       
            - Reapply the pod manifest:                                                                                 
              ```bash                                                                                                   
              kubectl apply -f                                                                                          
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/wrong_interface.yaml               
              ```                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                        
         5. Once the pod is back up, confirm it is running properly by describing it again:                             
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl describe pod kube-wrong-interface                                                                   
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         6. Since the pod itself is not automatically exposed externally, set up port forwarding to test the connection.
         In one terminal run:                                                                                           
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl port-forward pod/kube-wrong-interface 8765:8765                                                     
            ```                                                                                                         
            Then, in another terminal, run:                                                                             
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            curl http://localhost:8765                                                                                  
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the timeout issue by allowing the application running in the pod to accept
         external connections.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    Below are the steps to fix the port mismatch between your Kubernetes pod configuration, Dockerfile, and the    
         application code.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the pod definition to expose the correct container port (8765 instead of 8000).                      
                                                                                                                        
            Run the following command:                                                                                  
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's/containerPort: 8000/containerPort: 8765/'                                                         
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/wrong_port.yaml                         
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         2. Update the Dockerfile so that the container image exposes the same port (8765 instead of 8000).             
                                                                                                                        
            Run the following command:                                                                                  
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's/EXPOSE 8000/EXPOSE 8765/'                                                                         
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/Dockerfile                              
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Rebuild your Docker image. Change to the directory that contains the Dockerfile and run:                    
                                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            cd /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port                                   
            docker build -t marioutsa/kube-wrong-port-app .                                                             
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Delete the existing pod so Kubernetes can create a new one with the updated configuration.                  
                                                                                                                        
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl delete pod kube-wrong-port                                                                          
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         5. Reapply the updated pod definition to recreate the pod.                                                     
                                                                                                                        
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/wrong_port.yaml     
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         6. Verify that the pod is running and listening on port 8765.                                                  
                                                                                                                        
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl get pods                                                                                            
            kubectl describe pod kube-wrong-port                                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         7. Test the application by sending a curl request to the correct port (8765). Replace <pod-ip> with the correct
         IP address or use port-forwarding if needed:                                                                   
                                                                                                                        
            To port-forward, run:                                                                                       
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl port-forward pod/kube-wrong-port 8765:8765                                                          
            ```                                                                                                         
            Now in a new terminal, test with:                                                                           
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            curl http://localhost:8765                                                                                  
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the timeout issue caused by the port mismatch.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    ============== assistant ==============                                                                        
DEBUG    Below are the step-by-step instructions and shell commands you can run to fix the issue:                       
                                                                                                                        
         1. Verify the current pod labels. This helps us confirm the label that the service should use.                 
            Command:

         2. Update the service selector to match the pod’s label. The pod defined in                                    
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/incorrect_selector/incorrect_selector.yaml uses the
         label:                                                                                                         
            app: kube-incorrect-selector                                                                                
            In the service file found at                                                                                
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/incorrect_selector/app_service.yaml, change the    
         selector from "kube-incorrect-selector-application" to "kube-incorrect-selector".                              
            Command:                                                                                                    
              sed -i 's/kube-incorrect-selector-application/kube-incorrect-selector/g'

         3. Apply the updated service configuration.                                                                    
            Command:                                                                                                    
              kubectl apply -f                                                                                          
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/incorrect_selector/app_service.yaml                
                                                                                                                        
         4. Verify that the service now has the endpoints connected to the pod.                                         
            Command:                                                                                                    
              kubectl describe svc app-service                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
         These steps should correctly align the label selectors between your pod and service so that the service finds  
         and routes traffic to the pod endpoints.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their

         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get

DEBUG    Below are the steps to fix the port mismatch and labels in your Kubernetes configuration. The issues are that: 
                                                                                                                        
         • The Service file has a wrong targetPort (8756 instead of 8765).                                              
         • The Service selector doesn’t match the Pod's labels.                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         We will fix these problems by doing the following:                                                             
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the deployment file so that its label is “app: kube-port-mismatch” (which matches the Service        
         selector).                                                                                                     
         2. Update the Service file to set targetPort to 8765.                                                          
         3. Reapply the changes.

         1. Update the Pod’s label in the deployment file (port_mismatch.yaml) to match the Service’s selector:

         2. Update the Service file (app_service.yaml) to change targetPort from 8756 to 8765:

            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Apply the updated deployment and service:

            kubectl apply -f                                                                                            
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/port_mismatch.yaml                   
            kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml 
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Finally, check the status of the pod and service to ensure the changes took effect:                         
                                                                                                                        
            Commands:                                                                                                   
            ```                                                                                                         
            kubectl get pods                                                                                            
            kubectl get svc                                                                                             
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         After these steps, your application’s Service should correctly forward traffic to the container’s port and the 
         labels will match, which should resolve the 502 Bad Gateway error.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    ============== assistant ==============                                                                        
DEBUG    Below are step‐by‐step instructions and corresponding shell commands to troubleshoot and remedy the non‑Ready  
         condition for your pod. In this example, we’ll assume that the intended behavior is for the pod to become      
         ready. We need to modify the probe configuration in the YAML file so that it properly uses a readiness probe   
         (instead of a misconfigured liveness probe) and points to a valid endpoint. Follow these steps:                
                                                                                                                        
         1. Verify the current status of the pod to see its conditions.                                                 
            Run this command to describe the pod:                                                                       
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl describe pod readiness-http                                                                         
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         2. Check the pod’s container logs to see if there are any clues why it isn’t becoming ready:                   
            (This step uses the pod name found above.)                                                                  
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl logs readiness-http                                                                                 
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Modify the YAML file to change the failing probe from a liveness probe to a readiness probe. Use sed to     
         replace “livenessProbe” with “readinessProbe” in the file at the full path:                                    
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's/livenessProbe/readinessProbe/'                                                                    
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Next, change the httpGet path from “/invalid-path” to a valid endpoint (for example “/”) using sed:         
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's:/invalid-path:/:g'                                                                                
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         5. Reapply the updated configuration (this will update the pod configuration accordingly):                     
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl apply -f                                                                                            
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         6. Check the pods again to confirm that the pod eventually becomes Ready (it may take a few seconds for the    
         probe to pass):                                                                                                
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl describe pod readiness-http                                                                         
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         By following these steps, you change the probe from a misconfigured liveness probe with an invalid endpoint to 
         a properly configured readiness probe. This should allow Kubernetes to mark the pod as Ready once the container
         responds on the valid endpoint.
