DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                                               
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         1. Verify the Pod’s status and events.

         2. Notice from the application code that it binds to “localhost” instead of accepting external connections.    
         Modify the file so that the app binds to 0.0.0.0.                                                              
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash

         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/server.py                          
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Rebuild the Docker image to include your changes. Use a new tag (e.g., kube-wrong-interface-app-fixed here).
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            docker build -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/Dockerfile -t   
         kube-wrong-interface-app-fixed /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface     
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Update the deployment file to use the newly built image instead of the old one.                             
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            sed -i 's/marioutsa\/kube-wrong-interface-app/kube-wrong-interface-app-fixed/'                              
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/wrong_interface.yaml               
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         5. Delete the current pod so it can be recreated with the updated image. Then, apply the deployment file.      
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl delete pod kube-wrong-interface                                                                     
            kubectl apply -f                                                                                            
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_interface/wrong_interface.yaml               
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         6. Wait for the Pod to be up and running and then check its status:                                            
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl get pods                                                                                            
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         7. Test access to the application. For example, if you prefer to test from your local machine, you can         
         port-forward and then curl:                                                                                    
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```bash                                                                                                     
            kubectl port-forward pod/kube-wrong-interface 8765:8765                                                     
            # In another terminal:                                                                                      
            curl http://localhost:8765                                                                                  
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the timeout issue (caused by the application binding only to localhost) by
         having it listen on all interfaces.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    Below are step-by-step instructions with shell commands to address the port mismatch between your Kubernetes   
         pod configuration and your application:                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the pod YAML so the container port reflects the actual port (8765) that the Python application       
         listens on.                                                                                                    
            Run:

         2. (Optional but recommended) Update the Dockerfile to expose port 8765 instead of 8000 so that the image’s    
         metadata matches the running container.                                                                        
            Run:

            sed -i 's/EXPOSE 8000/EXPOSE 8765/g'                                                                        
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/Dockerfile                              
                                                                                                                        
         3. Rebuild the Docker image so that it includes the updated EXPOSE directive.                                  
            Run:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            docker build -t marioutsa/kube-wrong-port-app                                                               
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Remove the currently running pod so that Kubernetes creates a new one using the updated configuration.      
            Run:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl delete pod kube-wrong-port                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
         5. Reapply the updated pod configuration from the YAML file.                                                   
            Run:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/wrong_port.yaml     
                                                                                                                        
         6. After the pod is running, try making your curl request again (for example, if the pod is port-forwarded or  
         exposed via a service) to verify that it now connects to the correct port.                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the port configuration in your         
         deployment, Docker image, and application match.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         Follow these steps and your service should now correctly select the running pod endpoints.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    Below are the steps you should follow to fix the port mismatch issue.                                          
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the service file to use the correct target port.                                                     
            Run this command to change the targetPort from 8756 to 8765 in the service YAML file:                       
                                                                                                                        
            bash> sed -i 's/targetPort: 8756/targetPort: 8765/g'                                                        
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml                     
                                                                                                                        
         2. Fix the service selector so that it matches the pod’s labels.                                               
            The pod defined in port_mismatch.yaml has the label "app.kubernetes.io/name: app" while the service uses    
         "app: kube-port-mismatch". Update the service selector with:                                                   
                                                                                                                        
            bash> sed -i 's/app: kube-port-mismatch/app.kubernetes.io\/name: app/g'                                     
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml                     
                                                                                                                        
         3. Reapply the changes to update the Kubernetes resources.                                                     
            Apply the updated deployment and service definitions with:                                                  
                                                                                                                        
            bash> kubectl apply -f                                                                                      
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/port_mismatch.yaml                   
            bash> kubectl apply -f                                                                                      
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml                     
                                                                                                                        
         4. Verify that the pod is running and the service is correctly configured.                                     
            Check the pods:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                        
            bash> kubectl get pods                                                                                      
                                                                                                                        
            And check the service details:                                                                              
                                                                                                                        
            bash> kubectl get svc                                                                                       
                                                                                                                        
         5. Test access to your application.                                                                            
            Once everything is updated and running, retry accessing your application using its NodePort or the given    
         URL/IP address.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the 502 Bad Gateway error by ensuring that the service routes traffic to  
         the correct port on the pod.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         2. Delete the existing pod (if it already exists) so the new configuration is applied:                         
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl delete pod readiness-http                                                                           
                                                                                                                        
         3. Reapply the updated manifest:                                                                               
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl apply -f                                                                                            
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
                                                                                                                        
         4. Check the pod’s status to verify that the Ready condition is now True:                                      
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl describe pod readiness-http                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         Follow these steps in sequence and then review the output of the describe command to confirm that the pod is   
         ready.
