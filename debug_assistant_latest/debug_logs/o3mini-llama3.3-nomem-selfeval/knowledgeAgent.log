DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                                               
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         Following these steps will update the binding to listen on all interfaces and reapply the changes to ensure    
         your pod is reachable via curl.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

DEBUG    ============== assistant ==============                                                                        
DEBUG    Below are the steps you can take to resolve the port mismatch between what Kubernetes expects and the port your
         app is actually listening on:                                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the pod manifest so that the container port matches the actual port the app listens on (8765). Run   
         the following sed command to modify the file:                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            sed -i 's/containerPort: 8000/containerPort: 8765/g'                                                        
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/wrong_port.yaml                         
                                                                                                                        
         2. Delete any existing pod so you can apply the updated configuration:                                         
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl delete pod kube-wrong-port                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
         3. Reapply the updated pod manifest:                                                                           
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/wrong_port/wrong_port.yaml     
                                                                                                                        
         4. Verify that the pod is running and listening on the correct port:                                           
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl get pod kube-wrong-port                                                                             
                                                                                                                        
         5. Check the pod logs to ensure there are no errors and that the application indicates it’s serving on port    
         8765:                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl logs kube-wrong-port                                                                                
                                                                                                                        
         6. Try accessing the application using curl by specifying the correct port (8765). For example, if you’re      
         port-forwarding:                                                                                               
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            kubectl port-forward pod/kube-wrong-port 8765:8765                                                          
                                                                                                                        
            Then, in another terminal, run:                                                                             
                                                                                                                        
            bash                                                                                                        
            curl http://localhost:8765                                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
         This should resolve the timeout issue caused by the port mismatch.

         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.               
                                                                                                                        
         ## Instructions                                                                                                
         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                                               
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         4. Verify that the service now has proper endpoints with:                                                      
            ```bash

            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         These steps should resolve the "no endpoints" issue by correcting the mismatch between the service selector and
         the pod labels.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.

         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.

DEBUG    ============== assistant ==============                                                                        
DEBUG    Below are the step‐by‐step instructions with the exact shell commands you need to fix the issue:               
                                                                                                                        
         1. Update the service file’s targetPort from 8756 to 8765 so it matches the container’s port.                  
            Run:

            sed -i 's/targetPort: 8756/targetPort: 8765/g'                                                              
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml                     
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         2. Change the service’s selector to match the pod’s label. The pod has the label "app.kubernetes.io/name: app" 
         while the service currently selects "app: kube-port-mismatch".                                                 
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
            sed -i 's/app: kube-port-mismatch/app.kubernetes.io\/name: app/g'                                           
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml                     
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         3. Apply (or reapply) the deployment configuration so that any changes take effect.                            
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
            kubectl apply -f                                                                                            
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/port_mismatch.yaml                   
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         4. Apply the updated service configuration.                                                                    
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
            kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/port_mismatch/app_service.yaml 
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         5. Verify that the pod is running and that the service is correctly routing the traffic.                       
            Run:                                                                                                        
            ```                                                                                                         
            kubectl get pods                                                                                            
            kubectl get service app-service                                                                             
            ```                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         6. Once verified, try accessing your application again at the NodePort.

DEBUG    You are an AI called 'RAGit'. You provide instructions that a user should take to solve issues with their      
         Kubernetes configurations.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
         Your task is: Provide the user with instructions and shell commands to solve the user's problem.

         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you provide the user with actionable   
         instructions for their issue.                                                                                  
         - Enumerate your steps, and start from "1.". Each step should include a bash script of what the user should do 
         in a step by step basis. For example: "1. Check the logs. 2. Delete the deployment."Do not use live feed flags 
         when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         When generating output, prioritize providing actionable instructions (i.e., shell commands) over explanations  
         or justifications.                                                                                             
         Assume a moderate level of technical expertise on the part of the user (e.g., they're familiar with basic Linux
         commands and concepts).                                                                                        
         Don't worry too much about formatting or syntax; focus on getting the right information across.                
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'

         and indicate that the probe is failing.                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
           bash>                                                                                                        
           kubectl describe pod readiness-http                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
         2. In your YAML file                                                                                           
         (/home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml) the     
         probe is defined as a livenessProbe that checks the path “/invalid-path.” To have the pod report as “Ready” you
         need a working readiness check. One way to fix this is to change the probe from liveness to readiness and      
         update the HTTP GET path to “/” (assuming the container responds on “/”). Use sed to make these changes:       
                                                                                                                        
           bash>                                                                                                        
           sed -i 's/livenessProbe:/readinessProbe:/'                                                                   
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
           sed -i 's|/invalid-path|/|'                                                                                  
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
                                                                                                                        
         3. Delete the existing pod so that the updated configuration takes effect.                                     
                                                                                                                        
           bash>                                                                                                        
           kubectl delete pod readiness-http                                                                            
                                                                                                                        
         4. Reapply the updated YAML file to create the fixed pod.                                                      
                                                                                                                        
           bash>                                                                                                        
           kubectl apply -f                                                                                             
         /home/ubuntu/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/readiness_failure/readiness_failure.yaml           
                                                                                                                        
         5. Check the pod’s description again to verify that the Ready condition is now True.                           
                                                                                                                        
           bash>                                                                                                        
           kubectl describe pod readiness-http                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
         Following these steps should resolve the false Ready condition on your pod.
