         - Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                 
         - If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.

         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         and end that statement with this token: <|ERROR|>.                                                             
         - You have solved this issue when this goal is met: The status of all pods say 'RUNNING'                       
         - After every step, check to see if you have met the goal                                                      
         - If you believe you have met the goal, declare that you have solved the user's issue, and end that statement  
         with this token: <|SOLVED|>.

         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                         
         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you.                                   
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                            
         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         - If all and only all commands fail to execute, declare that there was an error in trying to solve the issue,  
         and end that statement with this token: <|ERROR|>.                                                             
         - You have solved this issue when this goal is met: The status of all pods say 'RUNNING'                       
         - After every step, check to see if you have met the goal                                                      
         - If you believe you have met the goal, declare that you have solved the user's issue, and end that statement  
         with this token: <|SOLVED|>.

         issue, and end that statement with this token: <|FAILED|>.                                                     
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                         
         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you.                                   
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                            
         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Instructions                                                                                                
         - If all and only all commands fail to execute, declare that there was an error in trying to solve the issue,  
         and end that statement with this token: <|ERROR|>.                                                             
         - You have solved this issue when this goal is met: The status of all pods say 'RUNNING'                       
         - After every step, check to see if you have met the goal                                                      
         - If you believe you have met the goal, declare that you have solved the user's issue, and end that statement  
         with this token: <|SOLVED|>.                                                                                   
         - If the steps do not solve the issue, or if you need more information, declare that you cannot solve the      
         issue, and end that statement with this token: <|FAILED|>.                                                     
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                         
         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you.                                   
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                            
         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         - If all and only all commands fail to execute, declare that there was an error in trying to solve the issue,  
         and end that statement with this token: <|ERROR|>.                                                             
         - You have solved this issue when this goal is met: The status of all pods say 'RUNNING'                       
         - After every step, check to see if you have met the goal                                                      
         - If you believe you have met the goal, declare that you have solved the user's issue, and end that statement  
         with this token: <|SOLVED|>.                                                                                   
         - If the steps do not solve the issue, or if you need more information, declare that you cannot solve the      
         issue, and end that statement with this token: <|FAILED|>.                                                     
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                         
         - Carefully read the information the user provided.                                                            
         - Run diagnostic commands yourself, then use the output to further help you.                                   
         - Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                  
         - Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                            
         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided           
         references, say 'I don't know'.                                                                                
         - Use markdown to format your answers.                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         - Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                            
         - DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit                                                                         
         - **Do not make up information:** If you don't know the answer or cannot determine from the provided

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         ## Guidelines                                                                                                  
         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit

         If a command invocation is successful but gives no stdout nor stderr, then that is because that invocation     
         resulted in no output to stdout or stderr.                                                                     
         If a command contains a placeholder name surrounded in angle brackets such as <pod_name>, for example, then    
         **do not** run that command as-is. First run a `kubectl get` command to find a real name to replace the        
         placeholder name, then run the suggested command with the replaced name of the resource. For example, if you   
         see `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n example_namespace`, first run `kubectl get pods -n example_namespace` and use  
         the name of the first pod you see.                                                                             
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         Do not use commands that open up editors like 'kubectl edit'                                                   
         If you do not conclude on an answer or a code then try again please.                                           
         You will run the commands as Instructed! Please feel free to change it if necessary and if it makes sense to!  
         You will solve the issue and run the commands!                                                                 
         When writing out your commands, use the real name of the Kubernetes resource instead of placeholder names. For 
         example, if your command is `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`, run `kubectl get namespaces` first to get       
         available namespaces.                                                                                          
         Do not use live feed flags when checking the logs such as 'kubectl logs -f'                                    
         When executing the shell commands please feel free to figure out whether or not it the command worked.         
         Do not use commands that would open an editor like 'kubectl edit'                                              
         DO NOT BY ANY MEANS USE kubectl edit
